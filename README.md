It's rough. But adding a show does work.
Currently, it will search both sickbeard and couchpotato for the string provided.
From there, you'll be given a list of both TV shows and Movies. Click on the show/movie
that you want, and select add. It's pretty simple.

To Use: 
  - Put in a web accessable directory
  - Move config.js.sample to config.js
  - Input your credentials into config.js
  - point browser to 'index.html'
  - Laugh at the progress that hasn't been made yet!

What Doesn't Work:
  - You can't add movies. It's late and I want to go to bed.
  - You can't view any of your media indexed with SB or CP.
  - You can't access SAB.
  - It can't print money.

What I want to Eventually Work:
  - Add Show Manager
    - Season Browser 
    - Episode Browser
      - Add to viewing queue
  - Add Movie Manager
    - Add / Remove Movies
    - Add to queue
  - Add Headphones Manager
  - Add SAB Manager
    - View in Progress Downloads
    - View Logs
  - XBMC remote   
    - Manage multiple hosts
    - Pause / play / etc...
    - Update library
